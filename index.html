		<h1>Hello! My name is Landon Smith.</h1>
		<p>
			I am currently a Junior enrolled at Wethersfield High School. I am interested in<br />
			Computer Science and other related fields like Engineering. When I grow up, I want<br />
			to invest my time in a career revolved around Computer Science. When I have free time<br />
			alone I like to code projects and applications on my computer.
		</p>
		<p>
			My goals for growth as a student and a member of the WHS community is to maintain<br />
			and get better grades, continue to work well with others and maintain a good<br />
			relationship with teachers and friends. Some strngths I have are working well with<br />
			others and solving different types of problems. Motivation and time management are<br />
			some improvements of weaknesses I have.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some examples of my growth as a student would be helping my sister with her capstone<br />
			project. By being a collaborator I created a website for my sister's Seniors4Strength<br />
			fundraiser. I have also coded many projects and small applications in my time<br />
			enrolled at WHS.
