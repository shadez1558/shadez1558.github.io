			Seniors 4 Stength is a non-profit program/organization that raises money<br />
			for seniors who are in medical debt and need help paying for it. Stength<br />
			4 Seniors donates half of the money they raise to the Healthwell Foundation,<br />
			and the other half directly to select seniors from communities around<br />
			connecticut. I have collaborated and communicated with my sister by creating<br />
			this website to help her complete her capstone project.

		<p>
			My Pokemon Simulation was a project I had completed after finishing all<br />
			of the units in my Computer Science class. This project allows you to<br />
			simulate a pokemon battle against a computer, giving you customizability<br />
			of your trainer, pokemons and it's moves. This project has really forced<br />
			me to apply knowledge to problem solve many different tasks and be able to<br />
			handle when things may or may not go wrong.
